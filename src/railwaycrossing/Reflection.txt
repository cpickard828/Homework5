  I made quite a few design changes. I had the gates observe both trains (good). I had the CarFactory for the right road (which
  contains all the cars going south on that road, as well as all the cars going west on EastWest) observe the CarFactory on
  the left road. I liked this decision because I could easily have westbound cars observe any cars on the left road, by passing
  the carFactory into car's move moethod. 
  However, I opted to only have the westernmost car check the position of the furthest car on the left road, instead of 
  checking the position of every single car. I felt that this was a good tradeoff as far as performance would be concerned 
  (although I did not test it checking all cars). The only issue with this, is, is that it takes awhile for the furthest car 
  on the left to be removed when it goes offscreen (1 to 2 seconds). So sometimes you'll see cars waiting to turn when they 
  could easily turn safely.

  My design as-is, would not scale up well at all. There's too many hardcoded values. For instance, a car can only turn left if 
  its currentX > 500, and it is going South, and it's currentY is within a certain range. What if Mayor Pete wanted to create
  the set of roads to the left of 500? Or have the EastWest roads be north (or south) of my specified y range? It simply wouldnt work.
  Cars can also do not observe a new gate when they change roads. This is not an issue for this project, because Professor Huang
  allowed us to place the EastWest road south of the tracks. But if we wanted to have the EastWest road north of the tracks,
  turning cars would not stop for the new gate.
